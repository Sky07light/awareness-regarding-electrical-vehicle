    <h1>About Electric Vehicles</h1>
    <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are vehicles that are powered by electric motors, rather than conventional internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline or diesel. These vehicles are gaining popularity due to their environmental benefits, including lower emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants compared to traditional vehicles.</p>
    
    <h2>Advantages of Electric Vehicles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Zero tailpipe emissions</li>
        <li>Reduced dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Lower fuel and maintenance costs</li>
        <li>Quiet and smooth driving experience</li>
        <li>Promotion of renewable energy integration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Electric Vehicles</h2>
    <p>There are three main types of electric vehicles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):</strong> These vehicles run entirely on electricity stored in rechargeable batteries.</li>
        <li><strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):</strong> These vehicles have both a conventional internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric motor. They can be charged from an external power source and also use gasoline or diesel fuel.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs):</strong> These vehicles combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. However, unlike PHEVs, they cannot be charged externally and rely on regenerative braking and the internal combustion engine to charge the battery.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Future of Electric Vehicles</h2>
    <p>The electric vehicle market is expected to continue growing rapidly in the coming years as technology improves, battery costs decrease, and government policies promote the adoption of clean transportation. With advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure, electric vehicles are poised to play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.</p>
